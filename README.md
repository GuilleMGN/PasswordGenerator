# PasswordGenerator

For this assignment we used JavaScript linked to an HTML page to generate a random password when a user requests one. 
The password was to have within 8 to 128 characters and the user can choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, 
numbers, and/or special characters. This was done by using a button with an event listener for user's click. This would open a series 
of prompts to confirm what type of password the user wanted to create. In JavaScript, I declared all possible outputs for each 
character category in different arrays and when the user was asked to confirm whether or not they wanted to use those in the 
password, it would store their selection as a boolean. In the JavaScript I also used functions to randomize and select which 
characters to display at the end result after being invoked. There are also alerts that appear to the user when they do not 
select any character type for their password or if they pick a character length larger or smaller than what is allowed.
